# PRODIGY_DS_04

Project Overview This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. This was completed as Task 04 during my Data Science internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

📊 Objective Analyze a dataset of social media posts (e.g., Twitter/X) to categorize sentiments as Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant.

Visualize the distribution of sentiments across different entities (brands/topics).

Identify trends in how public opinion varies across different subjects.

📂 Dataset The analysis was performed on the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset provided by Prodigy InfoTech.

Dataset Link: Social Media Sentiment Dataset

🛠️ Tech Stack Python: Core analysis.

Pandas: Data manipulation and mapping sentiment labels.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Creating sentiment distribution plots and heatmaps.

NLTK / TextBlob (Optional): If you performed any text preprocessing like tokenization or stop-word removal.

🔍 Key Steps Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values in tweet content and cleaned specialized characters.

Sentiment Distribution: Visualized the overall sentiment breakdown of the entire dataset.

Entity-Level Analysis: Filtered data by specific brands (e.g., Microsoft, Google, Nvidia) to compare public perception.

Visualization: Used grouped bar charts to show how sentiments fluctuate across different brands.

📈 Insights Brand Perception: [Example: Brand X had the highest percentage of positive mentions, while Brand Y saw a spike in negative sentiment.]

Data Volume: [Example: Certain topics had a much higher volume of "Irrelevant" tags, suggesting noise in the social media stream.]
